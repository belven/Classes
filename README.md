Welcome to the Classes mod. 

The server for this is: 85.236.101.19:27165 (version 1.6.4) (facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/517289625053919/)
Be mindful it's still a work in progress just as much as the mod is. It's using MobArena, WorldGuard and Multi-Verse. All the permissions are set up and working for these mods and mine. I just need to develop the arenas and classes. This server is for a comunity called NorDevNor (www.NorDevNor.co.uk) that mainly plays swtor.    

The aim of this mod is to give users the ability to have a class and utilise a set of spells and abilities. It’s currently a work in progress, all the abilities work there just aren’t that many right now. The main item used to cast is Lapis blocks. Each class will have passive abilities (the warrior takes no damage when at low health for a while) and active abilities (the archer webs its target on hit). 

Here’s a list of the classes and their abilities (the command to change to the class is in the brackets):

## Healer (/bchealer)
-	Heal 1 lapis block, heals the target or self if health is lower than 10 (5 hearts)
-	Bandage 1 stick and 1 paper, grants 4 hearts of temporary health 20 seconds if holding a stick or paper to self and/or target
-	Barrier 1 nether star creates an aura of knockback to everything but players including arrows etc

## Archer (/bcarcher)
-	Passive damage boost, the archer deals % extra damage based on the targets missing health
-	If the archer has a snowball the block where the targets head is changes to web for 5 seconds
-	If the archer holds wool they change the block they’re standing on to wool. This block will then become active after 5 seconds and every 2 seconds (for up to 40 seconds)  check for entities within 4 blocks (including players) , and set each entity on fire for 5 seconds and restore the block back to what it was

## Assassin (/bcassassin)
-	Heals ½ a heart on each attack
-	If they shoot an arrow they will teleport behind the entity. If they crouch after this they will teleport back to the last location they teleported from.

## Warrior (/bcwarrior)
-	If the warrior has 5 health or less left (2 ½ hearts) they can't be damaged for 30 seconds. This costs 1 nether star
-	Needs lots more abilties

## Mage (/bcmage)
-	 Casts a fire ball that deals 2x the normal damage costs 1 lapis block
-	If the mage is holding a nether star they will strike each entity (not including players) within 15 blocks with lightning. The mage is immune to damage form lightning. If any players are near the mobs they will take damage. 
-	Tornado uses a feather knocks back up to 3 mobs around target mob (Needs work on targetting)
